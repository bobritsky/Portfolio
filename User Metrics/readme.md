# Project work to analyze the effectiveness of advertising investments
**We have to find the reasons for the low ROI of the latest campaigns over the past few months.**

We have data about users acquired from May 1 to October 27, 2019:
- The server log with data on their visits,
- their purchases for this period,
- Advertising expenses log.

We will use user metrics analysis and graphs for CAC, LTV, ROI with breakdown by country, device and acquisition channels.
