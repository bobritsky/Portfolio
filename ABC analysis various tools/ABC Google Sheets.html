            <p>Hello there!</p>
            My name is Igor Bobritskii. Over my extensive experience working with international companies as a Business Development Manager, I have mastered various methods and tools for business data analysis. <p>Here, I'd like to share one of them with you: <span class="strong">ABC analysis.</span></p>
            <hr>
            <p>ABC analysis is a categorization technique used in inventory management and control, which divides items into three categories (A, B, and C) based on their importance and value.<br></p> <p>This method helps businesses prioritize their resources and focus on the most critical items that contribute the most to overall value.</p>
            <h3>Basics of ABC Analysis</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Category A:</li>
                    <p>Represents the most valuable items.</p>
                    <p>Typically accounts for a small percentage of total items (around 10-20%) but contributes a large percentage of total value (70-80%).</p>
                    <p>Requires tight control and management, frequent review, and high levels of accuracy.</p>
                <li>Category B:</li>
                    <p>Represents moderately valuable items.</p>
                    <p>
                    Usually makes up about 30% of total items and contributes about 15-25% of total value.
                    Managed with a moderate level of control and review.
                    </p>
                <li>Category C:</li>
                    <p>Represents the least valuable items.</p>
                    <p> Often constitutes around 50-60% of total items but contributes only about 5-10% of total value.</p>
                    <p>Managed with simpler, less rigorous controls due to their lower impact on overall value.</p>
            </ul>
        
            <p>Making it simpler - you take your sales by each product, sort it from biggest to smallest, calculate running total and split into 3 parts: products that in total make 80% of sales (category A), next 10% of sales (B) and the last 10% (C).</p> <p>Then you assign these categories to according products and start using them for control and review</p>

            <p>I will show you how to split sales data into ABC categories using Google Sheets and popular <a href="Superstore.xlsx">Superstore dataset</a> in Excel format</p>

        <div class="iter">
            <h2 class="step">1. Importing file to Google Sheets</h2>
            <p>
                Open Google Sheets and create an empty file.<br>
                Go to File menu and select <span class="strong">Import.</span> 
            </p>
            <img class="screenshot" src="Screenshots/import_excel.jpg" width="400">
        </div>
        <div class="iter">
             <p>
                On the next page select <span class="strong">Upload</span> and Browse to the downloaded <b>Superstore.xlsx</b> file or drag & drop it to the window.<br>
            </p>
            <img class="screenshot" src="Screenshots/import_excel_2.jpg" width="400">
        </div>
        <div class="iter">
            <p>
                Your imported file should look like this.<br>
           </p>
           <img class="screenshot" src="Screenshots/imported.jpg" width="800">
       </div>
       <div class="iter">
            <p>
                There are many columns to work with but now we're interested in <span class="strong">Product ID</span> and <span class="strong">Sales</span>.<br>
            </p>
            <img class="screenshot" src="Screenshots/product_id_sales.jpg" width="800">
        </div>

        <div class="iter">
            <h2 class="step">2. Aggregating sales by product with Pivot Table</h2>
                <p>First we need to group all sales by the product because now our sales table is just an order list. We got to make a list of unique products with total sales by each of them.<br></p>
                To achieve that we will use a <span class="strong">Pivot Table</span>.<br>
                <p>Select all table by clicking on the square below cell name or just pressing <span class="strong">Ctrl+A</span> and in the main menu select <span class="strong">Insert -> Pivot table - > Create</span> </p>
                <img class="screenshot" src="Screenshots/pivot1.jpg" width="400">
        </div>

        <div class="iter">
            You have created a new sheet with a data from orders which we can manupulate.
            <p>Collapse suggested actions with a small triangle.</p>
               <img class="screenshot" src="Screenshots/pivot2.jpg" width="800">
        </div>
         <div class="iter">
            <p>
                Now drag Product ID to the Rows section</p>
                <img class="screenshot" src="Screenshots/pivot3.jpg" width="400">
        </div>
        <div class="iter">
                <p>
                    Next drag Sales to the Values section</p>
                    <img class="screenshot" src="Screenshots/pivot4.jpg" width="400">
                    </div>
                <div class="iter">
                    <p>
                     Now we have our products grouped by Product ID and have a sum of sales for each</p>
                    <img class="screenshot" src="Screenshots/pivot5.jpg" width="600">
                </div>
                <div class="iter">
                    <p>
                     Great, now uncheck Show totals and sort Product ID's in descending order by the SUM of Sales</p>
                    <img class="screenshot" src="Screenshots/pivot6.jpg" width="300">
                </div>
                <div class="iter">
                    <h2 class="step">3. Copying plan data from Pivot table to the new sheet</h2>
                    <p>
                     Next step - we need to copy our data from pivot table to a new sheet as a plain text. To do that - <span class="strong">Ctrl+A</span> on Pivot table, create a new sheet and paste plain data with <span class="strong">Shift+Ctrl+V</span></p>
                    <img class="screenshot" src="Screenshots/ctrl_shift_V.jpg" width="400">
                </div>                                
                
                <div class="iter">
                    <h2 class="step">4. Calculating cumulative sales</h2>
                    <p>
                     Alright, now we have our sales by product figures sorted descending. Let's create a new column for "Cumulative sales" and type a formula into first cell:<br>
                    <span class="strong">=SUM($B$2:B2)</span>, press Enter and accept suggested autofill. Or double-click on the small blue box in the bottom-right corner of a cell.<br>
                    It will fill our column with calculated cumulative sum of sales. 
                    </p>
                    <img class="screenshot" src="Screenshots/cumsum_autofill.jpg" width="600">
                </div>                                
                
                <div class="iter">
                    <p>
                     Next thing you need to do - for the percentage of total sales calulation we need to have a total sales figure - and it's exactly the last cell in our "Cumulative sales" column.<br>
                    Select that cell and name it as "total_sales" (of cource you can address it by it's attributes - C1863, but calling it by name is easier)
                    </p>
                    <img class="screenshot" src="Screenshots/total_sales.jpg" width="400">
                </div>                                

                <div class="iter">
                    <h2 class="step">5. Calculating percent from total sales</h2>
                    <p>
                     Now give a name to a new column - "Perc from total".<br>
                     Type a formula to the first cell:<br>
                    <span class="strong"> =C2/total_sales</span><br>
                     Press Enter and fill column with that formula. Select column and set data type to a percentage.
                     
                    </p>
                    <img class="screenshot" src="Screenshots/perc_from_total.jpg" width="600">
                </div>   
                
                <div class="iter">    
                    <h2 class="step">6. Applying formula to make an ABC split</h2>
                    <p>
                     Next - make a new column - "ABC sales".<br>
                     Type a formula to the first cell:<br>
                    <span class="strong"> =IFS(D2<=0.8, "A", D2<=0.9, "B", D2<=1, "C")</span><br>
                     Press Enter and fill column with that formula by double-clicking blue box in bottom-right of the cell.<br><br>
                     How that formula works: IFS is a multiple-conditions evaluation, for each given condition it will give corresponding result: if D2 value is less or equal to 0.8 (= 80% of the sales) than it will write "A" to the cell and so on.
                                        
                    </p>
                    <img class="screenshot" src="Screenshots/abc.jpg" width="600">
                </div> 


                <div class="iter">
                    <h2 class="step">7. Making Ranking for each product</h2>
                    <p>
                     We've already done ABC categorisation - now let's make even more! Create a "Rank sales" column. We will give each product a rank in the sales in corresponding ABC category so we could use it in future sales analysis.<br>
                     Type a formula to the first cell:<br>
                     <spam class="strong">=COUNTIF($E$2:E2,E2)</spam><br>
                     Press Enter and fill column with that formula by double-clicking blue box in bottom-right of the cell.<br><br>
                     How that formula works: COUNTIF counts number of occurencies of a value (E2) in a given range ($E$2:E2). So literally we count number of A or B or C in our category column and that's exactly a rating: for the first A in the region it will find 1 A, for the second A our region will contain 2 rows with A in each - so result will be 2 etc. When our range will extent  to the first B occurency - COUNTIF will count number of "B" in whole regions containing many "A"'s and one "B" - so result will be 1 etc.
                                        
                    </p>
                    <img class="screenshot" src="Screenshots/rank_simple_countif.jpg" width="600">
                </div> 
                <div class="iter">
                    <h2 class="step">8. Merging ABC and Rank data with main table</h2>
                    <p>
                     Ok, we've done ABC categories and ranking of sales in each category. Now we need to join this data with the data in the main Orders sheet.<br>
                     To do so we will use VLOOKUP function.<br>
                     Make a new "ABC sales" column in main Orders sheet and start typing a formula:
                     <p>=VLOOKUP(select data we're looking to: E2, select region where we look for it: goto to our ABC analysis sheet and select all by clicking box to the upper-left from row numbers and column names, then put a number of a column we will get values from: 5, and last type False for exact match of product ID we're looking to.)</p>
                     Finally your formula should look something like this:<br>
                     <span class="strong">=VLOOKUP(N2, Sheet1!$1:$2364, 5, False)</span><br>
                     double-click blue box to fill entire column with formula

                    </p>
                    <img class="screenshot" src="Screenshots/vlookup_abc.jpg" width="800">
                </div>

                <div class="iter">
                    <p>
                     Next you will do the same with Rank:<br>
                    <span class="strong"> =VLOOKUP(N2, Sheet1!$1:$2364, 6, False)</span><br>
                     We've used same VLOOKUP by Product ID but now took column #6 with Rank data.           
                    </p>
                    <img class="screenshot" src="Screenshots/vlookup_search.jpg" width="500">
                </div>  

                <div class="iter">
                    <p>
                     That's it for today!
                     <p>You can download <a href="Superstore_processed.xlsx">processed Superstore</a> with all finished steps and examine it if you still have any question.</p>
                     Next time we will practice same ABC & Ranking but with different tools: <span class="strong">SQL, Python and Tableau</span>.<br>
