# ABC analysis is such a great business tool
...for keeping eye on your product portfolio, for supply planning, marketing purposes etc.

Basically it's just a segmentation of your product portfolio based on amount of sales and 
giving A category for most valuable products (more sales), B for less valuable and C for the least.

My point was trying to make it using different tools - **Python, SQL, Google Sheets and Tableau**.
Data I've been using is a Superstore sales file in *.xlsx format.
